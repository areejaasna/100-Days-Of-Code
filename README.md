# 100-Days-of-code
This is the repository that will keep track of my progress. I am starting a few things: learning JavaScript from basics, engaging in the 100 days of code challenge by Replit (Python), and practicing 30 minutes of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). I will be learning all these and maintaining my consistency.
